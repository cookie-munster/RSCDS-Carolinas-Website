# Why is Scottish Country Dancing Awesomeâ€½

Scottish Country Dancing is an international hobby, with over 300 groups dancing worldwide. Dancers organize and attend a local class as part of a branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society (RSCDS). Scottish Country Dance is a type of folk dance that is highly social and welcoming to all, regardless of age, gender or experience level. Learn more at [the RSCDS website](https://rscds.org/get-involved/new-scottish-country-dancing).

# Information about the RSCDS Carolinas Branch

The mission of the Carolinas Branch is to support local Scottish Country Dance groups across our region. We organize and fund large events to bring dancers together, support teachers and local groups, and keep dancers connected through communications and links to the Royal Scottish Dance Society. 

## Communications
If you have ideas on how the branch could support your local group (or help start one!) please reach out.

To sign up for our newsletter or to make inquiries about the branch please contact our secretary Brian at [thecarolinasbranch@gmail.com](mailto:thecarolinasbranch@gmail.com). 

## Membership
While it is not required to start dancing locally, membership in the Carolinas Branch supports our ability to put on regional events and support scholarships for local teachers and dancers. As an RSCDS member, you are also kept in touch with communications from headquarters, discounts on RSCDS events, and a discount in their online store.
